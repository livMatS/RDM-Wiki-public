## dtool

The above abstract description of a dataset requires a standardized implementation. We maintain datasets with a simple tool called [dtool](https://dtool.readthedocs.io/). `dtool` defines a standardized way to attach metadata to a dataset and handles transfer of datasets between storage systems. Please maintain all of your data in `dtool` dataset. There is also a [paper](https://peerj.com/articles/6562/#) [^1] describing `dtool`.
